My rigity-roo ahh os
# Can i run this with a Intel Core Pentium?
No. The distro only supports x86_64(64 bits) due to Arch dropping 32-bits and the distro contaning latest kernels
# Is it based on fully Arch?
You could say, but you can install Bedrock Linux via the OOBE.
# Can i disable the OOBE on first boot?
Technically yes, but it is reccomended to not do it
# Why is the first version called Pipis when there is no pipis?
for shits and giggles
